**Project 4**
I will be explaining the importance of responsive aweb Design fr Project 4.
Some important things to touch on are:

- Width adjustments
- tap targets
- breakpoints
- flexbox
- layout patterns

RWD is important becase you want your page to look good on all device screens.
Mobile, Tablets, and Laptops/Desktops. Not only do you want it to look good, but you also want
it to be easy to use, such as keeping the buttons big enough.
