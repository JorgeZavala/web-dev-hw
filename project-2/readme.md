# **Project 2**

**Part 1**

 The first part of project 2 has been very interesting. I have learned the basics of HTML which includes comments, elements, head and body elements, and semantics.

 I used HTML to make an Index page about making brownies. So far the page consists of a list of ingredients and instructions along with a header and short paragraph. I got to practice making ordered and unordered lists, using "emphasis" and "strong" tags, and other code

The second part of Project 2 had a ton of new information. First, I created a new page for my instructions to make my brownies. This time, I used a table to create a very clean looking layout for the instructions. I leaned how to make table rows, table headings, and table data, as well as some styling for the table.

I also created a Form page. I created a review page so my readers could share their opinions about my brownies. I created some text fields for their name and email, which are required. I made some "radio" buttons so they could rate my brownies either "Poor", "Average", or "Great" which is preselected. There is a button users can press to upload pictures of their brownies as well as a comment box for any additional comments. At the bottom of the page there is a "Submit" button as well as relative links back to the Home page and the Instructions page.

The final part was very interesting since we learned how to embed media into our webpage, like videos and music. A huge part of the internet consists of videos and music so i'm really glad I learned how to put those on a website!
