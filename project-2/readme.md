# **Project 2**

 The first part of project 2 has been very interesting. I have learned the basics of HTML which includes comments, elements, head and body elements, and semantics.

 I used HTML to make an Index page about making brownies. So far the page consists of a list of ingredients and instructions along with a header and short paragraph. I got to practice making ordered and unordered lists, using "emphasis" and "strong" tags, and other code
