      "I decided that it was not wisdom that enabled poets to write their poetry,<br>
     but a kind of instinct or inspiration,<br>
     such as you find in seers and prophets<br>
     who deliver all their sublime messages<br>
     without knowing in the least what they mean."<br>
     -Socrates
