I have decided to write my website about Mark Cuban and his book "How to Win at the Sport of Business"
It is a business book and but it had a sporty theme to it a bit so I think i can make the theme of the
website classic, but a little fun as well. Since i will the cover of the book on the website, I should pick
some fonts that compliment the book title's. It is a blocky serrif font so I will need to find a serrif font that
works with that for my headings and subheadings. I also want a san-serrif font for my paragraphs that
 will work with that as well

 My color pallete consists of different blues and black.
