I have decided to write my website about Mark Cuban and his book "How to Win at the Sport of Business"
It is a business book and but it had a sporty theme to it a bit so I think i can make the theme of the
website classic, but a little fun as well. Since i will the cover of the book on the website, I should pick
some fonts that compliment the book title's. It is a blocky serrif font so I will need to find a serrif font that
works with that for my headings and subheadings. I also want a san-serrif font for my paragraphs that
 will work with that as well

 My color pallete consists of different blues and black.

**UPDATE**
I updated my website woth a few diffferent things. I put a proper navigation baron my page so it looks a lot nicer.
I also learned more about positioning so I created a side quote and aligned it on the right side of my home page.
I used this same technique to create a "buy now" button on my Sample page as well. Also, I adjusted the size of my containers
so the content did not overflow out of it.
