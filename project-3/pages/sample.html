      <div class="sample"><p>I love the sport of business. I love the competition. I love the
fire of it. It’s the feeling of the clock winding down, the ball in
your hands, and if you hit the shot you win ... all day, every
day.</p>
<p>Relaxing is for the other guy. I may be sitting in front of the
TV, but I’m not watching it unless I think there is something I
can learn from it. I’m thinking about things I can use in my
business and the TV is just there.</p>
<p>I could take the time to read a fiction book, but I don’t. I
would rather read websites, newspapers, magazines,
looking for ideas and concepts that I can use. I spend time
looking for ideas and concepts that I can use. I spend time
in bookstores because one idea from a book or magazine
can make me money.</p>
<p>I’m not going to go to dinner with you just to chat. I’m not
going to give you a call to see how you are. Unless you
want to talk business. Other guys play fantasy sports. I fire
the synapses to get an edge.</p>
<p>That’s what success is all about. It’s about the edge.
It’s not whom you know. It’s not how much money you have.
It’s very simple. It’s whether or not you have the edge and
have the guts to use it.</p>
